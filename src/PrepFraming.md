Background and context
The reach goal for our project is to create a website with interactive visualizations of data associated with sexual assaults on college campuses. This would almost definitely include a map, and could also include more in-depth visualizations (graphs, charts, etc.) for specific colleges. Right now, we don’t have a data set, but we are playing around with basemap and have code that plots the coordinates of certain colleges on a map of the United States.

Key questions
What information do you think would be relevant on a website like that? Can you think of visualizations that have been confusing in the past? Would you be interested in seeing a zoomed in view of any areas in particular? Which colleges/types of colleges would you be interested in seeing depth on (how should we decide what to showcase)?

Agenda for technical review session
We want to have a collaborative ideation session, followed by an open discussion.

Can you think of cool ways to visualize data?
Are there any visuals you’ve seen that have been confusing?
Is there particular information you would like to see in graphics or text?
