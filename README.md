# Final-Project

### Title:
**ItHappens**

### Description:

The goal of our project is to create a series of interactive visualizations showing data on the frequency of sexual assault cases at four year colleges across the United States. The stretch goal of this project is to create an interactive website with different kinds of visuals - such as maps - showing the colleges that reported a nonzero number versus the college that reported zero.

In order to create certain visualizations on this data we had to first find data from a variety of sources and use pandas and csv files to combine the data in ways that we could use in later libraries, such as matplotlib and basemap.

### Getting Started:

Used with python 2.7

Required packages/programs:
* Matplotlib
* Matplotlib Toolkits Basemap
* Pandas
* Numpy - should have been installed

### Installation:

To install Matplotlib: sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

To install Basemap: sudo apt-get install python-mpltoolkits.basemap

To install pandas: sudo apt-get install python-pandas



### Usage:
The program takes CSV files as input and yields a map of colleges across the United States with color and size coded dots, as well as yet-to-be-determined other figures. It can be run with “python [filename]” in the terminal. Files that can be run include:
* object_basemap.py - draws US map with dots and US map with shading
* object_bm.py - draws US map and a zoomed in subplot when clicked
* otherpictures.py - creates a polar plot comparing Ivies
